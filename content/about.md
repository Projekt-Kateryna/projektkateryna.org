## 1. Purpose

### Overall political goal

Make the general audience **aware** of Ukrainian history, culture and language. Fight **lack of education** and knowledge, annihilate centuries of one-sided **Russian propaganda**, create **understanding** and public **support** for the Ukrainian nation, its people, its culture and deep relations to **other European nations**. 


### Method

Provide high-quality information on Ukrainian history, culture, people and language where the free world is looking for it: On **Wikipedia**, Wikimedia **Commons** and **Wikidata**, according to the rules and practices designed by the Wikimedia Foundation. Directly enable this in at least half a dozen languages and create good conditions for another dozen languages.


### Why »Projekt Kateryna»?

The suggested name is a reference to the oil painting **Катерина** by Taras Shevchenko (1842) [uk.wikipedia.org/wiki/Катерина_(картина_Шевченка)](https://uk.wikipedia.org/wiki/Катерина_(картина_Шевченка)). Modelled after »Projekt Fredrika» (see [en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Projekt_Fredrika](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Projekt_Fredrika)), we suggest a female name to be picked (as history is full enough of men anyway).

We also explicitly suggest the **spelling** »Projekt Kateryna», to underline that **English is only one out of many languages** to be supported, and one whose transcription differs the most from the original Ukrainian language.


## 2. Problem definition


### Overall problem definition

Even the best of the frequently used sources of neutral information – Wikipedia – **lacks an objective picture** of the suppressed Ukrainian nation. Descriptions in most languages are distorted by the long-term effects of Russian oppression during the Russian Empire and during Soviet times. 


### Example: The »Ukraina» article on svwp

The Swedish overall Wikipedia article [Ukraina](https://sv.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukraina) – arguably the single most influential description of Ukraine in Swedish – is heavily biased towards the Russian propagandistic description of Ukraine as "barely a state". 

It has a header "The Ukrainian nationalism during the 19th and 20th century", without really describing it – except that it killed Jews. The header "Famine and industrialisation" happens to touch that "the Ukrainian culture blossomed during the 1920s with the approval of the Bolsheviks", but does not describe it.  And "The area became a national unity (partially coinciding with the language spoken in the area) only through the inception of the short-lived Ukrainian people's republic (1918-21) and then again as a Soviet republic during the 20th century".

What is not mentioned is a description of the nationalism, what it reacted against, who the Ukrainian authors and other actors were during the 1920s. 

And going further back in history, there is no deep analysis of the battle of Poltava, no mentioning of the loyalties of Mazepa still causing controversies up to this day.

There is also no mentioning of the 1872 anti-Ukrainian legislation [https://uk.wikipedia.org/wiki/Емський_указ](https://uk.wikipedia.org/wiki/Емський_указ) or other root causes of Ukrainian nationalism.


## 3. The opportunity


### There is an awareness of the problem

While Russia's version of history is still the prevalent default even in the German or French perception of history, the brutal war has opened the eyes for the educated audience: Perhaps the established truth isn't true, after all? There is a willingness to hear a different story.


### There is a platform to spread the story

As »Ukraine's version of history» is based on scientific reality, Wikipedia provides the perfect platform for spreading it. Wikipedia is **multi-lingual**, highly **credible** and **omnipresent**.


### The platform even scales to AI

Wikipedia and in particular Wikidata is heavily relied upon by ChatGPT and other modern AI. This means that the version of reality which is in effect in Wikipedia and Wikidata is the one that affects public perception for many years to come.


### There are new, good sources

The Yale lectures by **Timothy Snyder** (autumn 2022) are available as **transcripts** and eminently **quotable** as well as highly educational. They are nearly **devoid of Russian bias**, and highly **credible** in the eyes of all relevant audiences.


## 4. Content


### People

In Wikipedia, articles about people are the most popular ones, based on how frequently they are read. It is thus important that relevant Ukrainian authors, musicians, painters, scientists, philosophers, politicians, military officers, and other notable individuals have good articles, good portraits or photos, and thorough metadata on Wikidata. It is also important that they are portrayed as Ukrainians, and that their names are correctly transcribed into various languages (not merely English), including recorded pronunciation guides.


### Cities, areas, places

Places is another frequently read category of articles on Wikipedia. There are good guidelines for what constitutes a good article. 

Of special relevance for Ukrainian places is the proper transliteration from Ukrainian to the language in question. These language communities have strong opinions on tradition; for example, in Swedish, the best-known places with an "established" spelling diverging from current Ukrainian-Swedish transliteration rules are Krim (not Krym), Kiev (not Kyjiv), Odessa (not Odesa) and Gammalsvenskby (an original Swedish name). Most if not all other names can use current Ukrainian-Swedish rules. 


### Ukrainian history and culture

The key articles on Ukrainian history and culture deserve the most attention. This includes not just textual contents, but maps, pictures, other illustrations, links, categories, navigation bars, and other Wikipedia concepts that form the overall representation of the Ukrainian nation on Wikipedia.


## 5. A role model: Projekt Fredrika


### Swedish Finland on Wikipedia

Projekt Fredrika was established 2017 in order to improve the coverage of Swedish Finland and Swedish in Finland on Wikipedia, in Swedish and other languages.

The project is organised through a project page in Wikipedia, currently in [Swedish](https://sv.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Projekt_Fredrika), [Finnish](https://fi.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikiprojekti:Projekt_Fredrika), [English](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Projekt_Fredrika), [German](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Projekt_Fredrika), [French](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikip%C3%A9dia:Projekt_Fredrika), [Russian](https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Википедия:Projekt_Fredrika), and [Estonian](https://et.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vikipeedia:Projekt_Fredrika) (not yet Ukrainian). It is supported through the registered association Projekt Fredrika rf (see [https://projektfredrika.fi/](https://projektfredrika.fi/)).


### The project name

The project is named after [Fredrika Runeberg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fredrika_Runeberg), born Fredrika Tengström, a Finland Swedish novelist, journalist and the wife of Finland's national poet [Johan Ludvig Runeberg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johan_Ludvig_Runeberg) (a contemporary of Taras Shevchenko, with a similar role towards Finland's culture). She was a pioneer of Finnish historical fiction and one of the first female journalists in Finland.

### Lena Jefimenko, Ukrainian Project Lead

Olena Yefimenko. Master of Economics. Manager. Since 2008, the founder, owner and CEO of a chain of restaurants. Organizer of the “Festival of goodness” Kyiv 2015. Completed a one-year course at the Kharkiv School of Architecture. Speaks 4 languages. She is currently studying Polish and Swedish, in parallel with her studies at the Faculty of Philosophy of Karazin Kharkiv State University. Lena is learning Polish, as the closest relative of Ukrainian, an integral part of Ukrainian history, and one of many glues that ties Ukraine together with the rest of Europe.

### Robert Silén, Technical Project Lead

Robert Silén. Master of Science 2010. Robert has worked with Kaj Arnö in various roles for the past ten years. He was part of Projekt Fredrika from the beginning in 2017. His Wikipedia handle [Robertsilen](https://sv.wikipedia.org/wiki/Användardiskussion:Robertsilen) is behind most of the edits done as part of Projekt Fredrika.

Robert's action bias approach complements Kaj - and this combination has proven critical to walk the talk. Robert speaks three languages fluently and grasps several more. He does basic editing, programming, etc, enough to scale whatever impact we are making with data or themes that we are working with.
