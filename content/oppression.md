Ukraine's culture and language have been oppressed and made a victim of [Russification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russification) for more than 300 years. With local variations, the concept of Russification applies directly to all parts of the former Russian empire, such as Finland (where Projekt Kateryna was established), the Baltics and Poland. But Russification has extended its tentacles deep into Western Europe, including Germany and France, through successfully selling a Russo-centric view of many of its former colonies into the public opinion.[^1]

We found this list of actions of Russification in Ukraine [on Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/solohanna/posts/pfbid02Joga4VEQL75R4SusXszovpgCapRCtbHxS6QSzqENWVBQ6WNhzLMpy3ctXrU2e7LRl).[^2] It may be inaccurate, but it is a great start. It may even be partial, but it is likely a much better representation of reality than the current "established truth" on Ukraine's history, which is mostly written by Russians. 

We need your help to create the rigour needed by Wikipedia! We need to find appropriate sources for these claims – or, for those of the claims that stand up to the requirements of Wikipedia on encyclopaedic information. The validated and documented claims should then be reflected on the appropriate Wikipedia articles, in several relevant languages, as we believe it would be a mistake to limit ourselves to English. The article [Russificiation in Ukraine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russification_in_Ukraine) is a good start, but there are many more to critically review. Identifying articles to correct in multiple languages is as big of a task as correcting the actual content. 

We will add languages as needed, but as a starting point, we are providing the list in these languages: [English (en)](/russification-of-ukraine/), Estonian (et), German (de), Finnish (fi), French (fr), Polish (pl), Russian (ru), Swedish (sv), and Ukrainian (uk).

[^1]: We explicitly mention Finland, Baltics, and Poland for a reason. These countries are "privileged" in having more insights. In particular, these three entities stand out because they have something in common in that they are all EU and NATO members, and yet slightly different in their post-WW II relationship to the Soviet Union. Finland was never behind the Iron Curtain. Poland was, but wasn't part of the Soviet Union. The Baltics were Soviet states. So Finland, the Baltics and Poland have three flavours, three variations in experiences and narrative, towards Russification.

We eliminated them from the list, as our scope is Russification. Yes, there have been and are other forms of cultural imperialism. They may deserve attention at some point, but those are not our current biggest problem.
