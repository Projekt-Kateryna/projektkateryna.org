Ukraine's culture och language has been oppressed and made a victim of [Russification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russification) for the past 350 years - in the similar manor to Azerbaijan, Belarus, Finland, Germany, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Bessarabia/Moldova as well as cultural minorities within Russia/Soviet Union. 

Below is a list of examples in Ukraine's history. This is a prime example of an unofficial, initial check-list for Projekt Kateryna on what themes and Wikipedia articles to critically review.

It is important that this information reaches not only Ukrainian or English readers, therefor we will translate this list and make it available in: English (en), Estonian (et), German (de), Finnish (fi), French (fr), Polish (pl), Russian (ru), Swedish (sv), and Ukrainian (uk). Identifying articles to correct in multiple languages is as big of a task as correcting the actual content.

This is by no means a complete history of the Russification of Ukraine. Russia has been opressing the Ukrainian language and culture for over 350 years. Yes, many in Ukraine speak Russian, but not by choice. There are many Ukrainian speakers who have not been able to pass on their language and culture to the next generations.
